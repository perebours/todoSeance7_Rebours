Welcome to the documentation of the project "Pokedex"
=====================================================

**Author:** Pierre-Emmanuel Rebours  
**contact:** pe.rebours@etu.emse.fr  
This Project allows the user to find some pokemon data by giving the id of the pokemon.

.. note::
    This Project was an exercice for my engineering studies to illustrate some good software development practices.

After cloning this repository, if you have a Java environment on your machine, you can directly run the commands.
To know how to run the project check out :doc:'usage' section.
